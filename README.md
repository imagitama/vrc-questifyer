# VRC Questifyer

A Unity plugin that makes it easy to create a Quest version of a VRChat avatar.

Tested with the Canis Woof by Rezillo Ryker in Unity 2019.4.31f1 with VRC SDK 2022.04.21.03.29.

## Steps

Start in Android (Quest) mode.

1. Install the plugin `.unitypackage`
2. Duplicate the scene that contains your PC avatar (tip: rename it with "Quest" on the end) and open it
3. Open PeanutTools -> VRC Questifyer
4. Drag your avatar into the field
5. Select the settings you want
6. Click "Questify"

It will keep the original avatar in the scene so that you can repeat the process as many times as you like.

## Development

## Release

Package PeanutTools/VRC\*Questifyer as a `.unitypackage`. Rename to `peanuttools_vrcquestifyer_$version.unitypackage`
